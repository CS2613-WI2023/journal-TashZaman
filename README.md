## **Syntax & Semantics**
### Operators

Basic operations can be broken down into a few sub components: Arithmetic, Comparative, Bitwise, and Assignment.

Within the Arithmetic operations are simple addition: "+", multiplication: "*", division: "/", and subtraction: "-".

Within the Comparative operations are the usual compare: "==", greater/less than: "<" or ">", greater/less than or equal to: "<=" or ">=".

Within the Bitwise operations are AND: "&", OR: "|" and Shift: "^".

Within the Assignment operations are assign: "=", addition assign: "+=", and subtraction assign: "-=".

### Code Execution

Programs should always be named as a .py file so that they can be compiled and ran via the command line. 

### Variable Declaration:

In python, variables do not need to be declared with a specific type as it is mutable (can change). The variable type is automatically set after a value is given to them. We can also manually set the variable with a primative data type to make it immutable (cannot change). Common primative types consist of: int, str, float, double and boolean
