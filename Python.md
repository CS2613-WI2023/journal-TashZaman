## **Syntax & Semantics**
### Operators

Basic operations can be broken down into a few sub components: Arithmetic, Comparative, Bitwise, and Assignment.

Within the Arithmetic operations are simple addition: "+", multiplication: "*", division: "/", and subtraction: "-".

Within the Comparative operations are the usual compare: "==", greater/less than: "<" or ">", greater/less than or equal to: "<=" or ">=".

Within the Bitwise operations are AND: "&", OR: "|" and Shift: "^".

Within the Assignment operations are assign: "=", addition assign: "+=", and subtraction assign: "-=". It is important to note that all variables are considered pointers in python.

### Code Execution

Programs should always be named as a .py file so that they can be compiled and ran via the command line. 

### Variable Declaration

In python, variables do not need to be declared with a specific type as it is mutable (can change). The variable type is automatically set after a value is given to them. We can also manually set the variable with a primative data type to make it immutable (cannot change). Common primative types consist of: int, str, float, double and boolean. We also have access to abstract data types such as lists, arrays, queues, dictionaries and tuples.

### Miscellaneous

Lines of code can be commented using "#".

Python does not require semi-colons after each line of code. Instead, semi-colons are used to concatenate multiple statements into one line.

## Data Structures and Libraries

Among the data structures are the abstract data types mentioned previously.

### Lists

Lists are essentally more flexible arrays. They are capable of inserting duplicate values and are usually always ordered. 

### Tuples

Tuples are variables that are capable of storing multiple values/characteristics. They are also immutable (cannot change).

### Dictionary

Dictionaries are a list that are capable of storing key:value pairs. A value can be obtained in a dictionary given the correct key.

### Libraries

Libraries are modules that can be imported into a project which are capable of providing additional functionality. There are various libraries that are specialized in certain areas of study such as: pandas, numpy and matplotlib which are primarily used in data science.
